      "My first Job in robotics. Which was very exciting to me. I just finished my bachelor in electrical engineering, which is why I started in the electrical engineering department. My main topic was reverse engineering a tool we used for flashing our electrical motors. The tool was only available on windows, but most engineers used Linux. A bit of CAN Signal analysis and Python wizardry created a library that was apparently further used long after I was gone (source: friends of mine that worked here after me).",

      "This project accompanied me for the most of my time during my master studies. It started with working on locating sounds sources, which later allowed the robot to look into the direction of the speaker closest to it. In between I had my first leadership experience by guiding some other students towards building a UI that made it easier to assign and execute tasks on the robot. It ended with my master thesis in which I used a generative algorithm, in order to optimize the placement of our muskoskeletal actuators for a hypothetic exoskeleton arm. The exoskeleton never made it into a real life prototype, but writing the simulation taught me a lot about C++, Python and Robotics itself.",

      "Here I spent so far my longest time in a single company. I started during my master studies and stayed for some more years after I finished my master. Here I learned the difference between a programmer/coder and a software engineer. While building Java backends I learned how to think about a solution and talk with someone about it before you start coding. I also had my first real frontend experience here. In that project I found my love for it and was so motivated that I later took over the project as its team lead. The company also allowed us to have side projects, which I used to learn how to animate in 3D with Three.js. It was a great time here and it was a hard decision to leave, but I wanted to get back into robotics and I wanted to further use my newly acquired frontend skills.",

/*
Thoughts, so that I don't forget them
- date next to list point
- descriptions should be written like a story instead of what they currently are
- skills on the left highlight if they are in the list of "active" skills
- when scrolling through, the current entry is a bit bigger and in the front, the other are a bit smaller and transparent (see adams list animations)
- skills on the left have indicators that show how trained I am (three dots are probably enough)
