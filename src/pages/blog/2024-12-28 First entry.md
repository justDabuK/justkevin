# First entry
The blog is here and the blog is now. 

I finally had the courage and energy to combine my web dev knowledge, my recently (almost 3 months ago) bought domain and my mostly unused vercel account to create this.

A blog. For you to read, for me to write and hopefully a motiation for me to keep up my tinkering.

It is currently ugly as hell. Let's hope I soon have the energy to change that and do some CSS wizardry here and there. 

See ya hopefully soon,

Kevin
