# Habbit Tracker - The beginning

Like many people before me, I have the idea of tracking my habbits. Now while there are many apps and websites for this out there, it's always nicer to use something you've written yourself, isn't it?

Now thinking about how I want to do this my first thought is "Wouldn't this be a nice chance to finally try out [nuxt](https://nuxt.com/)". A bit of research later, asking the void of the internet what database matches good with a nuxt application, unsure yet if I want to self host on a raspberry Pi or if I just go with one of many cloud solutions, I stumble upon [supabase](https://supabase.com).

Half a minute later I gave supabase access to my github account and I supposedly have postgres Database running.

Now the question is, what should I actually put into the database? Some highly detailed wiremocking and database planing later I came up with this:
