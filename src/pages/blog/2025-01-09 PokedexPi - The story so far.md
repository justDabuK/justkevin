# PokedexPi - The story so far
And so the story unfolds. I sit here, equipped with a Raspberry Pi 5, a HyperPixel and a Raspberry Pi Camera module 3 and big dreams. 

I asked myself "Wouldn't it be nice to build myself a camera". As although I am not that much of a photographer, I thought that using something I build myself would definitely increase the possibility of me taking pictures. So I imagined myself taking pictures, of birds, of trees of building. And I immediately thought "Well but if I take photos of these things, wouldn't it be nice to know what they are". And as AI is still the hype topic for quite sometime know and there is by now not just an AI camera module but also a ai hat for the Raspberry Pi, I thought "Well couldn't I build something that detects what I am taking photos of, and couldn't I then have the photos be grouped by what one can find on them, and couldn't I whenever I have internet connection download some description of what is on those pictures", and the idea of the PokedexPi unfolded itself before my inner eye.
