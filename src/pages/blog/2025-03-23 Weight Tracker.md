# Weight Tracker

After the ambitious plans that I had when I worked on
the [Habit Tracker](/blog/2025-03-07%20Habbit%20Tracker-%20The%20beginning), nothing happened for quite a while.
I did set up the supabase database. And I did fill it with data from time to time. But the energy burst necessary to
create the nuxt application never came.

And then I remembered something an old colleague of mine said once.

> "Everything any client actually wants is excel. They just don't know it."

While that definitely is an oversimplification of what it means to be a business analyst and to understand a clients
needs, it does have a grain of truth in it.

- clients usually have some data spread over multiple sources
- they usually want to combine that data in someway
- And then they'd like to see it visualized in an accessible way

Again oversimplification. But often enough this is what a lot of projects have in common. And my habit tracker is no exception.

So after remembering that quote I thought "why not. What should I be ashamed of, let's try using google sheets at least for my weight data". And so I did what you can see below.

It is simple, it is stupid, and it is actually all I need. Setting up the data was even easier than I expected

And I already tried out extending the table and the chart automagically updates accordingly. Like my colleague said, 
all I needed was excel, or in my case google sheets. 

Let's see if this will help me keep track of my weight as I wanted to. 

Keep it simple stupid my friends. See ya,
